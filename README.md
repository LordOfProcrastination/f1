# F1 Event

I created this project as part of my web-development exam. It contains information about a fictional event, includes information about the drivers and teams in this event and a quiz about F1.
The project uses an API with full CRUD, so it is possible to view, add, edit and delete people from the event.

## Technology used

I used Javascript and Typescript in my React project, and C# for my API. I used bootstrap as my CSS framework

### How to run application

You run this application by first acitvating the api using the "dotnet run" or "dotnet watch" command in your console inside the API folder. Then access the main folder and run "npm run dev".
